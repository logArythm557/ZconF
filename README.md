# ZconF

ZconF is an attempt to create a Zinger&trade; conversion Framework in C#. It was conceived during a discussion over how much it would cost to have a KFC&reg; Zinger&trade; Burger every day for a year.

# Roadmap

- create database of Zinger&trade; prices globally, sorted by country code and postcode
- adjust for local currency and exchange rates
- programmatically obtain the price of a zinger (reverse KFC app API?)
