# Zconf

ZconF is an attempt to create a Zinger&trade; conversion Framework in C#. It was conceived during a discussion over how much it would cost to have a KFC&reg; Zinger&trade; Burger every day for a year.

Currently, the program takes the number of Zinger&trade; burgers as user input, and multiplies them by the price of a Zinger&trade; burger in Adelaide, Australia ($5.95).

# Roadmap

- ### <b>FIX dollars2zingers.cs</b>
- create database of Zinger&trade; prices globally, sorted by country code and postcode
- reverse the process, list how many Zinger&trade; burgers can be purchased with a user-defined amount of money
- adjust for local currency and exchange rates
